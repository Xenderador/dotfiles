# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal collection of dotfiles! These configurations are tailored for my daily development environment, and they enhance the functionality of various tools I use regularly.

This repository includes my custom configurations for the following tools:

- **Zsh**: My preferred shell, with custom prompts, aliases, and plugins.
- **[Neovim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM&t=382s)**: A powerful text editor setup with plugins and custom key mappings. For more details on setting up Neovim, check out.
- **Tmux**: A terminal multiplexer to manage multiple terminal sessions.
- **Alacritty**: A fast, GPU-accelerated terminal with a highly optimized configuration.
