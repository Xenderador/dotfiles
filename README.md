# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal collection of dotfiles! These configurations are tailored for my daily development environment, and they enhance the functionality of various tools I use regularly.

This repository includes my custom configurations for the following tools:

- **Zsh**: My preferred shell, with custom prompts, aliases, and plugins.
- **Neovim**: A powerful text editor setup with plugins and custom key mappings. For more details on setting up Neovim, check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM&t=382s).
- **Tmux**: A terminal multiplexer to manage multiple terminal sessions.
- **Alacritty**: A fast, GPU-accelerated terminal with a highly optimized configuration.
- **Yazi**: A tool for easy navigation and management of directories and files in the terminal. For more details on setting up Yazi, refer to [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKb3cHDD9hw).
- **LazyGit**: A terminal UI for Git, simplifying Git operations. Learn how to set up and use LazyGit by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihg37znaiBo&t=301s).
- **System Configurations**: Includes other essential configuration files for macOS/Linux environment optimization.
