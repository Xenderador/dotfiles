# Tmux Setup

This section describes the Tmux setup I use to enhance my terminal workflow. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows me to manage multiple terminal sessions from one window. Here's how I have configured it:

## Key Features:

- **Multiple Windows and Panes**: Split terminal windows and create new windows within the same session.
- **Custom Keybindings**: I have configured custom keybindings for better navigation and session management.
- **Plugins**: I use the `tpm` (Tmux Plugin Manager) for managing plugins that enhance the functionality of Tmux.

## Installation:

1. **Install Tmux**: If you don't have Tmux installed, you can use `brew`:

   ```bash
   brew install tmux

2. Install Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm)
To make the most out of Tmux, weâ€™ll use tpm (Tmux Plugin Manager) to manage plugins. To install it, run the following command:
  
       git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

 ### Useful Commands:
   
 Start Tmux:
  
    tmux

 Detach from session:

    C-a d

 List sessions:

    tmux list-sessions

Kill session:

    tmux kill-session -t session_name

### Troubleshooting:

Reloading Config: If you make changes to your .tmux.conf file and want to reload it in an existing Tmux session, use:

    C-a r
