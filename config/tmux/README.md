# Tmux Setup

This section describes the Tmux setup I use to enhance my terminal workflow. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows me to manage multiple terminal sessions from one window. Here's how I have configured it:

## Key Features:

- **Multiple Windows and Panes**: Split terminal windows and create new windows within the same session.
- **Custom Keybindings**: I have configured custom keybindings for better navigation and session management.
- **Plugins**: I use the `tpm` (Tmux Plugin Manager) for managing plugins that enhance the functionality of Tmux.

## Installation:

1. **Install Tmux**: If you don't have Tmux installed, you can use `brew`:

   ```bash
   brew install tmux

   git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
   ```
