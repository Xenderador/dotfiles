# Alacritty Setup

This section outlines my **Alacritty** terminal configuration, which I use to enhance my terminal experience. Alacritty is a fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that focuses on simplicity and performance. Below is how I have set it up to match my preferences.

## Key Features:

- **GPU Accelerated**: Alacritty uses the GPU to render everything, resulting in faster performance compared to CPU-bound terminal emulators.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Alacritty comes with a minimal default configuration, allowing for deep customization via a simple YAML configuration file.
- **Cross-Platform**: Alacritty runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **TrueColor Support**: It supports full 24-bit color and is ideal for users who require high-quality color rendering.
  
## Installation:

### Install Alacritty

If Alacritty is not already installed, you can install it using `brew` (for macOS):

```bash
brew install --cask alacritty
